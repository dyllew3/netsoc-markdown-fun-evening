  We present a coordinate space for addressing elements on the Integer Spiral
  which is rotationally symmertric $90\deg$ about the origin. We develop and
  present useful supporting formulae, in terms of some integer $n$, for computing
  the coordinates of $n$ in this space, with a view to computing the $\ell_1$
  (taxicab) distance from $n$ to the origin.
