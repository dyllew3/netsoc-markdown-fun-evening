# The Turboencabulator

## Concepts
Now, basically the only new principle involved is that instead of power being 
generated by the relative motion of conductors and fluxes, it’s produced by the
modial interaction of magneto-reluctance and capacitive diractance. The original
machine had a base plate of prefabulated amulite, surmounted by a malleable
logarithmic casing in such a way that the two spurving bearings were in a direct
line with the panametric fan, as presented in [@turboencab].

The Retro Encabulator has now reached a high level of development, and it’s
being successfully used in the operation of milford trenions. It’s available
soon; wherever Rockwell Automation products are sold.
